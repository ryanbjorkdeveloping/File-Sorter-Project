THIS PROJECT IS OPEN-SOURCED, AND YOU CAN MAKE ANY NECESSARY EDITS TO THIS PROJECT OR TWEAK IT HOWEVER YOU LIKE. PLEASE CREATE A SEPARATE BRANCH IF YOU WANT TO ADD FEATURES TO THIS APPLICATION, AND IF IT WORKS, THEN YOU CAN CONVERT IT THEN.

For the basic application that I have now for this file sorter project, here is what it does in a nutshell: It's supposed to sort out your files throughout your computer, or it'll eventually do so.
Although for now, it's only going to sort out certain files within a specific folder by file type, and whether it's a Document, Image, or Music File type.
It lists based on the files depicted in numerous txt files that hold the database for all kinds of music, document, and image files in the respective txt files.

Here's how to run the project effectively:
-Don't try to edit the other classes beside the Runner class because you might break the code that I already have set. Within the runner, select where you want to have your different file locations located.
-You MUST create a file named "Specific Files Folder" with all the files you want to sort out based on their respective file types and put the file location of that folder
-When you run the application, it will have a button you press to organize the files within the Specific Files Folder and will sort them into their respectable places.
